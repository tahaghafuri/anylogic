						Go to Files tab in a repository, click on the menu and click Commits. You can now click on any commit to view it's files and then see what is changed in that file(diff view).

						<h3>11. UI enhancements and improvements(bottom sheets, settings)</h3>

						We keep refreshing the UI across GitNex from time to time. This time is no different, you will find many new layouts and enhanced UI acorss the whole app.<br><br>

						It is not limited to bottomsheets only. We have added UI refinements to everywhere possible this time.

					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>12. Remote search your project issues</h3>

						Until 4.2.0 searching issues have used local filter for that current page only instead of fetching things from remote. So we have replaced it with a remote search, now searching issues is more refined and will show you what you are looking for.<br><br>

						It works with issue filters nicely like milestone, open and close issues.

						<br><br>
						<p class="center para">

						<p class="center">

					<p>
						<h3>13. Show notification count when switch accounts</h3>

						A small but useful UI change to let you know about notifications. Now when you switch accounts, a popup will appear if there are any notifications for that account. So you don't have to go to nav drawer to check it anymore.

						<br><br>
						<p class="center para">
							<img src="../img/430/notificaiton-count-popup.png">
						</p>
						<p class="center">

						</p>
						
					</p>

					<p>
